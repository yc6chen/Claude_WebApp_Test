# Playwright E2E Tests

End-to-end tests for the Recipe Management Application using Playwright running in Docker.

## üéØ Overview

This directory contains Playwright E2E tests that run in a Docker container using the official Playwright image. Tests are designed to run seamlessly in the Docker environment with proper service discovery.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The E2E test setup uses:
- **Playwright**: Modern end-to-end testing framework
- **Official Playwright Docker Image**: `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0-jammy`
- **Docker Compose Profile**: Tests run via the `e2e` profile
- **Network Mode**: Tests share the network with the frontend service for proper service discovery

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running E2E tests, ensure:
1. Docker and Docker Compose are installed
2. The application services (db, backend, frontend) are running
3. The frontend is accessible at `http://localhost:3000`
4. The backend API is accessible at `http://localhost:8000`

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Run E2E Tests

```bash
# From the project root directory

# Run tests (simplest way)
./run-e2e-tests.sh

# Run tests with fresh build
./run-e2e-tests.sh --build

# Run tests and show report
./run-e2e-tests.sh --report
```

### Alternative: Using Docker Compose Directly

```bash
# Build the Playwright image
docker-compose --profile e2e build playwright

# Run tests
docker-compose --profile e2e run --rm playwright

# Run specific test file
docker-compose --profile e2e run --rm playwright npx playwright test recipe-app.spec.js

# Run tests in headed mode (with browser UI)
docker-compose --profile e2e run --rm playwright npm run test:headed

# Run specific browser
docker-compose --profile e2e run --rm playwright npm run test:chromium
```

## üß™ Test Suites

### Recipe Management Tests
Located in `tests/recipe-app.spec.js`:

1. **Basic UI Tests**
   - Display application title
   - Display recipe list
   - Open/close add recipe modal

2. **CRUD Operations**
   - Create new recipe with all fields
   - Display recipe details
   - Delete recipe
   - Handle multiple ingredients

3. **Form Validation**
   - Validate required fields
   - Handle empty states

4. **API Integration**
   - Load recipes from API
   - Handle API errors gracefully

5. **Accessibility**
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Accessible form labels
   - Keyboard navigation

6. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile viewport testing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Playwright Config (`playwright.config.js`)

Key settings:
- **Base URL**: `http://frontend:3000` (Docker service discovery)
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per test
- **Retries**: 2 on CI, 0 locally
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Screenshots**: On failure
- **Videos**: Retained on failure
- **Traces**: On first retry

### Docker Configuration

The Playwright service in `docker-compose.yml`:
- Uses profile `e2e` (won't start with regular `docker-compose up`)
- Shares network with frontend service
- Mounts test files and results directories
- Sets `BASE_URL` environment variable for service discovery

## üìä Test Reports

After running tests, reports are generated in:

- **HTML Report**: `./playwright-report/index.html`
- **JSON Results**: `./test-results.json`
- **Screenshots**: `./test-results/` (on failure)
- **Videos**: `./test-results/` (on failure)

### View HTML Report

```bash
# Open the HTML report
docker-compose --profile e2e run --rm -p 9323:9323 playwright npm run report

# Or open directly in browser
open playwright-report/index.html
```

## üîß Writing New Tests

### Test Structure

```javascript
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');
    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
  });

  test('should do something', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation
    await expect(page.locator('selector')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use `test.describe` for grouping** related tests
2. **Wait for network idle** before interacting with elements
3. **Use specific selectors** (role, text, test-ids)
4. **Add timeouts** for dynamic content
5. **Clean up test data** after tests
6. **Use page object pattern** for complex UIs

### Debugging Tests

```bash
# Run in debug mode
./run-e2e-tests.sh --debug

# Run single test file
docker-compose --profile e2e run --rm playwright npx playwright test tests/specific-test.spec.js

# Run with headed browser
./run-e2e-tests.sh --headed

# Generate code for test
docker-compose --profile e2e run --rm playwright npm run codegen
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Services Not Running

**Problem**: Tests fail because services aren't accessible

**Solution**: Ensure services are running first
```bash
docker-compose up -d
# Wait for services to be ready
sleep 10
./run-e2e-tests.sh
```

### Network Issues

**Problem**: Tests can't connect to `http://frontend:3000`

**Solution**: Check network mode in docker-compose.yml
- Playwright service should use `network_mode: "service:frontend"`
- This allows Playwright to access services via container names

### Port Conflicts

**Problem**: Port already in use

**Solution**: Stop conflicting services or change ports in docker-compose.yml

### Browser Launch Failures

**Problem**: Browser fails to launch in Docker

**Solution**: The official Playwright image includes all browsers
- Ensure using `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright` image
- Check Docker has enough resources (memory/CPU)

### Timeout Errors

**Problem**: Tests timeout waiting for elements

**Solution**:
- Increase timeout in `playwright.config.js`
- Add explicit waits: `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')`
- Check if services are actually running

### Test Results Not Visible

**Problem**: Can't access test reports

**Solution**: Results are mounted as volumes
```bash
# Check if volumes are mounted
docker-compose --profile e2e config

# Reports should be in ./playwright-report/
ls -la playwright-report/
```

## üöÄ CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  e2e-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Start services
        run: docker-compose up -d

      - name: Wait for services
        run: sleep 15

      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: ./run-e2e-tests.sh --build

      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: e2e/playwright-report/
```

## üìà Test Metrics

Current test coverage:
- **Total Tests**: 15+
- **Test Suites**: 3 (Main UI, API Integration, Accessibility)
- **Browsers**: 3 (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- **Average Runtime**: ~30-60 seconds

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

To maintain and improve tests:

1. **Add tests for new features** immediately
2. **Update selectors** if UI changes
3. **Keep Playwright updated** for new features
4. **Monitor test flakiness** and fix unstable tests
5. **Review failed tests** and update as needed
6. **Document test coverage** in this README
