## 🔄 How the System Works

### When Adding a New Feature:

1. **Develop the feature**
   - Implement functionality
   - Write tests
   - Ensure all tests pass

2. **Use the checklist**
   - Open `.github/FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Follow each item systematically
   - Check off completed items

3. **Update documentation**
   - Refer to `DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE.md` for guidelines
   - Update all relevant .md files
   - Verify cross-references work

4. **Commit everything together**
   - Code changes
   - Test changes
   - Documentation updates
   - All in the same commit/PR

### When Adding New Tests:

1. **Write the tests**
   - Backend or frontend tests
   - Ensure they pass

2. **Update test documentation**
   - Update test counts in:
     - `TEST_QUICK_START.md`
     - `TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md`
     - `TESTING.md`
   - Update coverage percentages
   - Add new test file descriptions

3. **Verify accuracy**
   - Run tests to confirm counts
   - Check coverage reports
   - Ensure examples are current

### When Creating Additional Documentation:

1. **Assess the need**
   - Is the feature complex enough to warrant its own doc?
   - Would it improve understanding significantly?
   - Check the guidelines in `DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE.md`

2. **Use the template**
   - Copy `.github/DOCUMENTATION_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Save to appropriate location (docs/, backend/, frontend/)
   - Fill in all relevant sections
   - Remove sections that don't apply

3. **Update existing docs**
   - Add link in `README.md` "Available Documentation" section
   - Add cross-references from related docs
   - Update `DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE.md` to list the new file

4. **Follow best practices**
   - Include clear examples
   - Add troubleshooting section
   - Link to related documentation
   - Add "Last Updated" date
   - Include maintenance reminders

   - Include real examples from the codebase
   - Verify information before committing

3. **Follow the checklist**
   - Don't skip items
   - Mark each as complete
   - Add notes for unusual situations

4. **Cross-reference appropriately**
   - Link to detailed docs from quick guides
   - Avoid duplicating information
   - Keep one authoritative source

5. **Review before committing**
   - Read through updated docs
   - Click all links to verify they work
   - Run tests to confirm counts
   - Check examples still execute

## 🚀 Getting Started

   cp .github/FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md my-feature-checklist.md
   ```

3. **Work through systematically**
   - Implement feature
   - Write tests
   - Update docs
   - Check off items

4. **Verify everything**
